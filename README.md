# Portfolio-project
In this project, I created a portfolio page from scratch using HTML and CSS. The task seemed daunting at first but once I sat down to do it, I was able to get the skeleton of what I wanted it to look like done in a couple of hours. After that I tried to figure out how I could apply the fade in effect that the mock up animation had for its images. 

Here is a screenshot of the deployed site.
